## 1. Introduction

The `python-console-snake` project is a recreation of the popular Snake game, implemented to run fully in the console using Python. The project was chosen to enhance programming, problem-solving, and software structuring skills in the first semester at VIT Bhopal.

---

## 2. Objectives

- To implement the Snake game logic in Python.
- To offer configurability (size, themes, fullscreen).
- To create an engaging user experience via the console.
- To understand version control through Git and GitHub.

---

## 3. Features

- **Console-Based:** No graphics libraries, runs only in the terminal.
- **Configurable:** 
  - Change game size (`small`, `medium`, `large`).
  - Play in fullscreen mode.
  - Select visual themes (`classic`, `minimal`, `jungle`, or custom).
- **Custom Themes:** Easily add new themes in the code and invite contributions.
- **Help Menu:** Accessible by running `python snake -help`, listing all command-line options.

---

## 4. Code Structure

- `menu.py`: Contains the main menu logic and startup routines.
- `snake/`: Directory for core game logic and theme files.
- `README.md`: Documentation file for instructions and details.
- `LICENSE`: MIT License file.

## 5. How to Run

1. Clone the repo:  
   `git clone https://github.com/helpershyam/python-console-snake.git`
2. Enter the folder:  
   `cd python-console-snake`
3. Run using Python:  
   `python snake`
4. Use `python snake -help` for detailed options.

## 6. Learning Outcomes

- Improved Python programming skills.
- Practical experience with modules, command-line arguments, and file structure.
- Gained knowledge of GitHub repositories and collaboration practices.
- Understood basics of software documentation and licensing.

---

## 7. Challenges

- Ensuring compatibility across different operating systems and terminals.
- Managing user inputs and real-time game updates in a console environment.

---

## 8. Conclusion

The `python-console-snake` project successfully simulates a Snake game in Python console, demonstrating software engineering concepts learned in the first semester. It encourages further learning and open-source contributions.
